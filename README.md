# Electronics

This is a repository with some personal projects

## [Centrifuge for All](CentrifugeForAll)
This is a simple project to make a low cost centrifuge, for use in many situations, like, universities, laboratories and remote places.

## [Traffic Lights](TrafficLight)
It was my first Arduino project (when I did not have the board it self) to see how to play with electronics
